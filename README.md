# LGBTQIA+ Project Plan
## Definition

### Scope 
The goal is to help users get better knowledge about LGBTQIA+ and promote the development of diverse communities. Basically, the user can retrieve the massive information about LBGTQIA+ and the organisation contacts for the knowledge development. The targeting group of users for this project will be the users in Ottawa only. Although people from all over the Internet can access our website, we will contain the information of LGBT organizations in just Ottawa. Besides, our project will not be available on mobile platforms like iOS and Android. It is just fully PC based website. Boolean Autocrats will also cease development on LGBTQIA+ application in September 2022.

### Specifications 
People from all over the internet will be able to access the website publicly but the information will be contained for the Ottawa region only.
It is designed as a fully functionally, friendly user interfacing and cost efficiency website application which helps the user to save time on searching the organisation resource.
The website contains a flexible feature which can redirect the user to the organisation’s home page in case the user is looking for more specific information.
Website security also comes in our top priority because if somehow hacker managed to hack the website then it will be a problem for the organisation’s information as well and also to make it virus-free, we are making sure to keep the security high using regular backups, strong passwords, and more aspects for protection purposes.
The website is using GoDaddy platform to host the website which is also low in cost efficiency and a kind of platform which has low traffic signal which makes it easy for the user easy to explore the website.


### Assumptions
The client will provide a database of the organization.
The client will provide contact info of the organization.
The client will provide the domain name of the website.
The client will update and maintain the website content.


## Schedule 
![Schedule](https://i.ibb.co/Yc6c98T/Capture.jpg)


## Resources
We will be using the information from these 4 main resources:
- https://www.depts.ttu.edu/: This resource has been taken for reference in view to understand the basic concept of LBGTQIA+.
- https://www.wappalyzer.com/: We will be using this website to investigate and learn the technology stacks of existing relevant applications about LGBTQIA+ and apply some of them in our project.
- https://stackoverflow.com/: In situations where we encounter technical problems, we will be using this website as a way to find solutions for our problems. If there are no existing solutions, we will use it as a Q & A platform to post our questions and ask if anyone has answers for them.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JluqTojuME: Youtube learning can deliver us more accuracy with the knowledge with the help of it’s visuality, we also can be able to define more tactics in order to enhance the design of the website.

## Communications 
Our group communicates primarily through Discord. Our group leader made a group in Discord to announce important information as well as to answer any of us who have questions. We also host weekly meetings through the Zoom platform. In addition, we do our meetings with Ten Oaks every two weeks to discuss the progress of the project.

## Risks 
Risk is the probability of any adverse event occurring. All projects are subject to risks, and these are the risk that we may face in our project: 

Expansion of the project: If the project’s source code is not well organized and maintained, project scaling may not only lead to lost time and additional costs, but also small chance of even project failure

Security risk: Since we are only a college group and we have not learned a lot about cybersecurity, our website may have some security holes that hackers can take advantage of. If this happens, organization information will be exposed and used by people who attack our website. This is the last thing we want, so we will try to prevent it from happening at all costs.

## Manufacturing and Test/Evaluation 
Testing, will be run on a regular basis along with the development phase, is critical in the process of developing high-quality software. Following the website testing, the customer is given a completed project that is free of faults, has good readability, and is deemed to be easy and convenient.

Some of the tests that we going do:
- Operating System testing using Windows, Linux, Mac.
- Browser testing like Google Chrome, Internet Explorer.
- Usability Testing.
- Performance Testing includes loading time of the web page and the input.
- Security Testing : users should be restricted to access log files where website data is stored.

We will perform these tests using automatic unit test as much as possible, reducing the amount of time spent on testing, thus increasing the overall efficiency of our project.
## Procurement 
Since the client would prefer to find a free hosting service to save their cost, We will find a complimentary service to host the website. The website will be run and tested locally in developer’s environments before getting published. In addition, the client will provide a list of organizations that will then be included in our database. 



## Intellectual Property 
According to the rules of Project with TenOaks Project, the client will own any intellectual property created for use in the Project website.



## Safety 
No primary safety risks concerns. However, participants must be mature enough to see the resources.
